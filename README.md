# AdvancedInmoovHead
A heavily modified, more animatronic-like version of Gael Langevin's original Inmoov head. This mod was started a few years ago, but has taken a little over a year to get initially published. Parts will be released incrementally upon completion of each part's final modifications. 

-Important:  My designs are based on other mods and designs, modded to fit my needs. A list of used models/mechanisms will be incrementally documented in this section of the repo and linked as necessary.
