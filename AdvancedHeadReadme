Advanced inmoov head readme

Important notes
----------------
	- Most of the existing Inmmoov designs will not work with this design, so, in most cases, you will need to print this parts.
	- The hole for each connector is 3mm; however, 4mm (M4) screws are used to ensure a tight hold on the screw in the printed parts. Nuts are also used to ensure the screw holds.


Build of materials 
-------------------
	- M4 screws in a variety of lengths (typically 10mm or more)
	- Square M4  nuts (dimensions (LxWxH): 9x9x3 mm) Link to the ones I bought: https://8020.net/14159.html
