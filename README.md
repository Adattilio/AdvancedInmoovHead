# AdvancedInmoovHead

Author: Alex Dattilo

A heavily modified, more animatronic-like version of Gael Langevin's original Inmoov head. This mod was started a few years ago, but has taken a little over a year to get initially published. Parts will be released incrementally upon completion of each part's final modifications. 

Important notes
----------------
- My designs are based on other mods and designs, modded to fit my needs. A list of used models/mechanisms will be incrementally documented in this section of the repo and linked as necessary. 
- Most of the existing Inmmoov designs will not work with this design, so, in most cases, you will need to print this parts.
