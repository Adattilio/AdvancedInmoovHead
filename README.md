# AdvancedInmoovHead

/Author: Alex Dattilo

A heavily modified, more animatronic-like version of Gael Langevin's original Inmoov head. This mod was started a few years ago, but has taken a little over a year to get initially published. Parts will be released incrementally upon completion of each part's final modifications. 

-Important:  My designs are based on other mods and designs, modded to fit my needs. A list of used models/mechanisms will be incrementally documented in this section of the repo and linked as necessary. 


Important notes
----------------
-
- Most of the existing Inmmoov designs will not work with this design, so, in most cases, you will need to print this parts.
- The hole for each connector is 3mm; however, 4mm (M4) screws are used to ensure a tight hold on the screw in the printed parts. Nuts are also used to ensure the screw holds.


Build of materials 
-------------------
- M4 screws in a variety of lengths (typically 10mm or more)
- Square M4  nuts (dimensions (LxWxH): 9x9x3 mm) Link to the ones I bought: https://8020.net/14159.html
