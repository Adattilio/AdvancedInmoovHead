# AdvancedInmoovHead

Author: Alex Dattilo

A heavily modified, more animatronic-like version of Gael Langevin's original Inmoov head. This mod was started a few years ago, but has taken a little over a year to get initially published. Parts will be released incrementally upon completion of each part's final modifications. 

Important notes
----------------
- My designs are based on other mods and designs, modded to fit my needs. A list of used models/mechanisms will be incrementally documented in this section of the repo and linked as necessary. 
- Most of the existing Inmmoov designs will not work with this design, so, in most cases, you will need to print this parts.

Build of materials 
-------------------
- Many M3 machine screws  of a variety of lengths (mostly 10mm or longer).  I use socket head screws for which the models are countersunk for.
- Many M3 square nuts (maximum dimensions allowed (LxWxH) : 5.4 x 5.4 x 2.5 mm)  Here is a product that will work : https://www.amazon.com/Honbay-100pcs-Stainless-Steel-Square/dp/B06XPFLNBS/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=m3+square+nut&qid=1588553497&sr=8-2
